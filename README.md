Hello, my name is Celso Kikuchi.
I am a Brazilian IT Professional, and lives in Fortaleza-CE, Brazil.
I was originally an Electronic Technician, started working with IT support, while I was studying Business Administration.
After I graduated, I decided to continue working with IT, having now more than 30 years of work experience.
I considered myself very lucky, as I worked and learned IT most of my career in excellent jobs with fantastic colleagues.
I worked for 16 years at Serpro, the biggest Latin American public IT agency, attending Brazilian government. Despite I don't have a background in Science Computing, their several training courses gave me a lot of knowledge.
I am experienced in Development (web and mainframe), Data Warehouse, and DevOps.

- ðŸ”­ I retired from my last work in August/2021, being financially independent, and dedicated to side projects since them.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning full cycle development.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me:
