Hello, my name is Celso Kikuchi.

I am a Brazilian IT Professional, and lives in Fortaleza-CE, Brazil.

I was originally an Electronic Technician, started working with IT support, while I was studying Business Administration.

After I graduated, I decided to continue working with IT, having now more than 30 years of work experience.

I considered myself very lucky, as I worked and learned IT most of my career in excellent jobs with fantastic colleagues.

I worked for 16 years at Serpro, the biggest Latin American public IT agency, attending Brazilian government. Despite I don't have a background in Science Computing, their several training courses gave me a lot of knowledge.

I am experienced in Development (web and mainframe), Data Warehouse, and DevOps.
